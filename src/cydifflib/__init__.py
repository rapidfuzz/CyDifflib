Module difflib -- helpers for computing deltas between objects.

Function get_close_matches(word, possibilities, n=3, cutoff=0.6):
    Use SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.

Function context_diff(a, b):
    For two lists of strings, return a delta in context diff format.

Function ndiff(a, b):
    Return a delta: the difference between `a` and `b` (lists of strings).

Function restore(delta, which):
    Return one of the two sequences that generated an ndiff delta.

Function unified_diff(a, b):
    For two lists of strings, return a delta in unified diff format.

Class SequenceMatcher:
    A flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type.

Class Differ:
    For producing human-readable deltas from sequences of lines of text.

Class HtmlDiff:
    For producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.
